Q1] Consider a data frame "df" with the following columns: "Name", "Age", "Gender", "Height", "Weight", "Grade". 
df <- data.frame( 
 Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "John", "Jane"), 
 Age = c(25, 30, 35, 40), 
 Gender = c("Female", "Male", "Male", "Female"), 
 Height = c(165, 180, 175, 160), 
 Weight = c(60, 75, 70, 55), 
 Grade = c("A", "B", "B", "A+") 
) 
1. Use the select() function in R to create a new data frame called "df_select" that 
includes only the "Name" and "Age" columns from the original data frame. 
2. Use the select() function to create a new data frame called "df_exclude" that 
excludes the "Height" and "Weight" columns from the original data frame. 
3. Use the select() function to create a new data frame called "df_rename" that 
renames the "Grade" column to "Achievement" in the original data frame. 
4. Use the select() function to create a new data frame called "df_reorder" that 
reorders the columns of the original data frame, with "Age" appearing before 
"Gender".

Q2] Consider a dataset "grades" with the following columns: "Name", "Subject", and "Score". 
grades <- data.frame( 
 Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Jane", "Michael", "Emma"), 
 Subject = c("Math", "English", "Science", "Math", "English", "Science"), 
 Score = c(85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 80) 
) 
Write R code to perform the following summarization tasks: 
1. Calculate the average score for each subject. 
2. Find the minimum score for each subject. 
3. Determine the maximum score for each subject. 
4. Compute the total number of records in the dataset. 
5. Calculate the overall average score across all subjects. 
6. Find the standard deviation of scores for each subject. 
7. Calculate the median score for each subject. 
8. Determine the sum of scores for each subject.

Q3] Consider the following dataset "students" representing students' scores in different subjects: 
students <- data.frame( 
 Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Jane", "Michael", "Emma"), 
 Subject = c("Math", "English", "Science", "Math", "English", "Science"), 
 Score = c(85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 80) 
) 
1. Group the dataset by "Subject" and calculate the average score for each subject. 
2. Group the dataset by "Subject" and calculate the maximum score for each subject. 
3. Group the dataset by "Subject" and calculate the minimum score for each subject. 
4. Group the dataset by "Subject" and calculate the total number of students in each subject. 
5. Group the dataset by "Subject" and calculate the standard deviation of scores for each subject. 
For each question, write the necessary R code using the group_by() function and appropriate summarization functions such as mean(), max(), min(), n(), and sd().

Q4] Consider the following dataset "students" representing students' information 
1. Filter the dataset to select students who are older than 20 years. 
2. Filter the dataset to select students who have a grade of "A". 
3. Filter the dataset to select students who have a GPA higher than 3.5. 
4. Filter the dataset to select students who are older than 20 years and have a grade of "A". 
5. Filter the dataset to select students who have a GPA higher than 3.5 or are younger than 19 years. 
For each question, write the necessary R code using the filter() function and use appropriate conditions using comparison operators such as <, >, ==, and logical operators such as & (AND) and | (OR).

Q5] Consider the following dataset "students" representing students' information: 
students <- data.frame( 
 Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Jane"), 
 Age = c(18, 20, 19, 21), 
 Grade = c("A", "B", "B", "A"), 
 GPA = c(3.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9) 
) 
1. Use the mutate() function to add a new column called "Age_Group" to the dataset, which categorizes the students into different age groups: "Teenagers" (age <= 19) and "Young Adults" (age > 19). 
2. Use the mutate() function to calculate a new column called "GPA_Scaled" that scales the GPA values to a 100-point scale, where the maximum GPA in the dataset corresponds to 100. 
3. Use the rename() function to rename the column "Grade" to "Letter_Grade" in the dataset. 
For each question, write the necessary R code using the mutate() and rename() functions to perform the desired operations on the "students" dataset.
