5] Create a vector "numbers" with elements 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Square each element of the vector and store the result in a new vector named "squared_numbers".
6] Create a vector "temperatures" with elements 25, 30, 28, 32, 29. Find the maximum temperature from the vector.
7] Create a logical vector "logical_vector" with elements TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE. Check if all the elements in the vector are TRUE.
8] Create a vector "ages" with elements 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. Find the average age from the vector.
9] Create a character vector "fruits" with elements "apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango". Sort the vector in alphabetical order.
10] Create a numeric vector "numbers" with elements 3, 7, 2, 5, 9. Find the sum of the vector. 
11] Create a vector "names" with elements "John", "Jane", "James", "Julia". Extract the first two elements of the vector.
12] Create a numeric vector "numbers" with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Add 1 to each element of the vector.
13] Create a numeric vector with all integers from 5 to 107.
14] Create a vector that contain all numbers from 1 to 17, where each number occurs the the same number of times as the number itself eg. 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3...
15] Create two numeric vectors of length 4 and test run all the basic operators (as seen in the table earlier) with these two as arguments.
